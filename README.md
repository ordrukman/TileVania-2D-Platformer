# TileVania-2D-Platformer
A fast-paced classic Side-Scrolling Platformer using Unity's Tilemap tool.


This project from Udemy course I took is called Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D. I took this course to learn Unity in C# & Code, 2D Video Games for Web, Mac & PC.

Gameplay:

A fun game with three stages that you have to go through and avoid contact with obstacles or enemies in the game while collecting as many coins that are scattered in stages.
The player has three lives and is shown at any given time the number of given lives and points he has achieved so far.
When completely disqualified returns to the first stage and starts from the beginning.
The player has the ability to shoot with the left mouse button that can kill the enemies.
The project is based on the course I took at Unity and implemented design templates of the code like Singleton and State.
